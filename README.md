# 😊 Emotion Detection System

The **Emotion Detection System** is a machine learning–based application that detects human emotions from facial expressions.  
It uses image processing and a trained model to classify emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Neutral**, etc.

This project is useful for applications like:
- Human–Computer Interaction
- Mental health monitoring
- Smart surveillance systems
- AI-based user experience enhancement
